# cv
CV created from a standard overused template from somewhere in internet, which I tailor from time to time a little to fit more or less text.

To run from tex to pdf:
1. Clone this repo
1. [Install LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)
1. Run in the root to generate pdf file `` texi2pdf cv.tex``
